### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

That's my profile on GitHub.com. It's slightly exciting to write it, because of using GitHub for the first time. I'm beginner in programming and I want to be a little bit smarter that now. My slogan is _"just keep studying!"_. Now I'm learning HTML, CSS and JS for create websites.

Good luck :)
